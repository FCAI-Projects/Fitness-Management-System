# Fitness-Management-System
This project aims to automate gym and fitness admission process as the admission process in gyms and selecting a trainer is difficult. Sometimes it is difficult to get a desired slot timing. Being healthy is the first thing to be kept in mind because most of the time our attitude depends on how we feel. Being healthy gives us the energy to work and do things. It is hard to get admission in health club when slots are full. This health club management system will help to overcome such problems by booking the desired slot online and pay fees by electronic money transfer.
